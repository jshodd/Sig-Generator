# Sig-Generator
This is a program I wrote while working for a dental insurance agency. Each employee needed an identical signature for gmail, which included pictures with links attached to them. The issue was that you could not simply copy and paste from word to gmail as the links would break and formatting issues would render the signature useless. I found that if you copy content generated from html, the formatting would go unchanged, including links. So I made this program to generate an html signature from inforation that is entered in through a promt.
